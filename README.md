This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) based school app bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It focuses on ACNH's best artist and dog: Keke Slider !

## Commands

To run the development server while you are working (to spread Keke's glory), use:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Cypress tests

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

### Build for production
