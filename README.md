This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) based school app bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It focuses on ACNH's best artist and dog: Keke Slider !

npm run dev
```
Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

```

### Build for production

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## About the project
