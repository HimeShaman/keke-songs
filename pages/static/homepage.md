K.K. Slider is a hippie-style traveling musician, which is reflected in his mellow speech towards the player. He comes across as someone who wants to be liberated, as shown by his rebellion against putting a price on his songs. This adds to the musician stereotype of going against a particular norm. 


K.K. has an obvious passion for performing for others, as he offers to play for people on a weekly basis. In Wild World, he seems to know Brewster fairly well.
After the player has established an upgraded Resident Services building, Tom Nook gives the player a goal of improving the island in order to convince K.K. to play a concert there. Once the required 3 star island rating is met, K.K. will arrive the next day to play a concert. After that, he will show up every Saturday and play a concert in the evening from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM. The player can request a song for him to play. Like in previous games, the player will receive an aircheck copy of the first song he plays, and the credits play during requested songs. If there is any event that takes place in the plaza on a Saturday, K.K. Slider will show up on Sunday instead, or Monday if two separate events are held on both weekends back-to-back such as the Bug Off and Fireworks Show.

In the 2.0 update, 12 new songs were added, which K.K. calls "new jams." If the player lets K.K. choose, he will most likely play a new jam if he hasn't played that song in the past already. During K.K. performances in 2.0, all villagers attending the performance will get out a light stick and jam. The player can hold a light stick during the performance and they can raise it, and if they do, all other villagers will raise their light sticks as well. At the end of the performance, everyone claps for K.K., and then the villagers put away their light sticks and take a seat.
